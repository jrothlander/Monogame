This is a very simple demo of a retro 1980's arcade starfield. I created this based on the starfield used in Galaga and use this going forward in my Galaga clone. 

This project demostrates a number of important features.

* Game Loop
* Game Services
* Game Components
* Frame Counters
* 2D Textures
* Back Buffer
* Screen Size
* SpriteBatch
* Creating random numbers, colors, and cordinates.
* 2D Vectors
