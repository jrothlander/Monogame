# Introduction 

### Cource Expectation

If you have a grasp on the basics of C#, I recommend you start with another course to get the basics under your belt. Come back here once you have a decent understanding of the basics of C#. If this describes you, Iâ€™ve included a section in the appendix for prerequisite courses and book reviews that will give you some ideas and a few recommendations on where to start. It should not take you long to work through the basics and there are significant resources available to help you. It is simply beyond the scope of this text to cover a C# introduction.

I have developed this text as a textbook for a game development course. I have made every effort to have the text stand on its own and separate from the course. It is intended to serve as a reference that you can return to again and again, as you need a refresher and need to look up details you may have forgotten or concepts you are struggling with, or areas you need to reenforce. I recommend you download the free course materials so you can work through the chapters and can experiment with the code as it is being discussed, as I am unable to include the entirety of code in the text simply due to space constraints. And of course, if you prefer to have access to video lectures where I explain and demonstrate the code, you are always welcome to join the course at any time.   

If you are new to C# but have the basics down, you will be fine. Working through this text will be a great way to build your C# skills. If you are comfortable with or have already installed Visual Studio .Net, know how to create a new solution and project, are familiar with adding NuGet packages, and feel comfortable with creating classes, writing functions, the basics of object oriented programming, have been exposed to unit tests, and feel comfortable with the C# syntax, lists, arrays, properties, fields, variables, etc. then you should be fine. If you have the basic concepts down but still struggling with some of the details, this course should go a long way to help you reenforce these concepts.

### What if my goal is to be a 3D game developer? Is it worth the time to learn 2D?

2D and 3D game development skills are significantly different skillsets in many regards. However, I believe that everything you learn 2D game development will help you in 3D. Since we are using MonoGame for our game development framework, we will be implementing our own game engine. That may sound complicated, but trust me, it is not. It can be challenging, but it does not require any math beyond simple trigonometry (using sin and cos) and some basic matrix algebra. 

The other side of this question is if we should be using a game engine such as Unity or UnReal. There are advantages and disadvantages. The major disadvantage with starting in 3D with an engine, is not taking them time to build a strong foundation, and having to carry along a massive game engine when you only need a small part of it for your game. Other disadvantages include things like the ever-changing licensing, fees, breaking API changes, and other issues that our out of your control but that effect your game.  

Using MonoGame, our approach will be to simply build the game engine components we need. If you continue to 3D engines, having worked through your own engine components will go a long way to reenforce concepts that may not be as obvious when the engine is handling it all for you. I personally would not want to be a 3D game developer that struggles with the basic concepts of 2D game development. This is why, I really want to encourage you to start with some simple 2D games and build up to more complex 2D, before moving to 3D. I think it is important to develop skills using 2D math, linear algebra, vector math, 2D animation, etc. as foundational skills.  

I mention this because I suspect some of you will be more interested in 3D and will be wondering if you need to waste your time working in 2D. The answer is yes. It is my opinion that starting in 2D and moving to 3D is a great way to build a foundation. Jumping directly into 3D engines is not necessarily a bad idea, and you can build 2D games using a 3D engine. But I think starting in 2D game framework like MonoGame is simply a better approach.
